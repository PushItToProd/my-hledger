- add support for relative dates - e.g. date=-1
- add support for partial dates - e.g. date=14 or date=05-14
- consistently output info on stderr. stdout should only include the resulting
  transactions
- create internal globals txn_date and txn_status corresponding to environment
  vars DATE and STATUS
- validate that allcaps globals are set in all functions that require them

- make it unneccessary for transaction templates to call insert_txn
  unfortunately, something like this doesn't work:
      source "$template" | save_txn
  (per experiment `can_pipe_see_sourced_var`)

print_basic_txn
- check all required globals

save_txn
- check all required globals
- validate that journal_path exists before saving
- allow saving to a custom file
